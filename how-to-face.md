# 📝 Professional Scrum Master 1 (PSM I) **ambaena empirical guide** to face the assessment.

**`Disclaimer:`** First to clarify that this is based on my **own experience** dealing with **Scrum PSM-1 assessment**. This is not the absolute truth.

## **Where** i am ready?.

- ❌ Reading or understanding the **Scrum Guide is not enough**.
- ✅ **Consistently pass** the preparation exams you are using. I mean doing **some in a row with score close to 100%**.
- ✅ **Be able to perform** at least **3-5 Scrum Opem Assessments** in a row with **100%**. In less than **6-8 mins each** of them.

## **How** to face the assessment.


- **Before the assessment**:
    - 🤓 **Read** the official [SCRUM Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) at least a couple of times more **before facing the assessment**.
    - 🤓 **Read** the cheatsheet (preferably your own cheatsheet) as well. 
    - 🔍 **Review questions** that you have **failed most recently in your practice assessments** (public exams on the internet, **Scrum Open Assessments**).
    - 🏋🏻‍♂️ Do at least **one Open Assessment** to **warm up/prepare** you and your mind to what is to come.

- **During assessment**:
    - 💻 Use a **computer/laptop exclusively to take the exam.** Only to answer the questions. Scrum does not allow you to copy the statement, so you will not be able to take advantage of this to look up a question in Google. 
    - 📚 **Prepare another computer for the support material**, remember that the assessment **is open book**. You can use any resource you want to solve it. I recommend:
        - Have the [Scrum Guide](https://scrumguides.org/scrum-guide.html) open. Ready in case you need it. *(`control + F`)*
        - Have your favorite cheatsheet open. *(`control + F`)*
        - In case you are not a native English speaker, have a **dictionary open in your browser**.
        - A window with **Google to search** in case of doubt the **statement** of the question in Google. For 90% of them you will find it on some website. Although the **answers will not necessarily be correct**, use what you find to **support your own thinking**. In case you have no idea, better to answer what you find on Google than nothing :)
    - 🏃🏻‍♂️ In the **first loop do not waste too much time on any question**, use the **marker 🏷 to mark all the questions that you have answered with doubt**.

    - 🕵🏻‍♂️ Spend the **remaining time to review** marked questions or even **Google it**.
