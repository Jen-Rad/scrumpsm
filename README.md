## **What is SCRUM?**

Scrum is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through
adaptive solutions for complex problems.

## **Big Picture**

![alt text](img/overview-diagram.png "SCRUM Big Picture")

- **`Artifacts`**: *Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog and Incremental.*

    - **Product Backlog:** The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team. 
    - **Sprint Backlog:** The Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how)
    - **Incremental:** The Increment is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints.

</br>

- **`Events`**: ***Sprint**, Sprint planning, Daily, Sprint review and Sprint retrospective*

    - **Sprint:** The Sprint is a container for all other events. 
    - **Sprint Planning:** Sprint Planning initiates the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the Sprint.
    - **Daily:** The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute event for the Developers of the Scrum Team. The purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary, adjusting the upcoming planned work.
    - **Sprint review:** The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward the Product Goal is discussed.
    - **Sprint retrospective:** The Sprint Retrospective concludes the Sprint. The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness inspecting how the last Sprint went.

</br>

- **`Accountabilities`**: *Product Owner, Developers and SCRUM Master*

    - **Product Owner**.
    - **Developers:**.
    - **SCRUM Master:**.

## **Scrum Guide**

Scrum Guide as the official standard about Scrum!.

It is recommended reading, it is a very condensed document with all the necessary information to understand SCRUM.

## **Agile Manifesto**

Now we will discuss about the 12 principles of Agile Manifesto in four differents categories:

- Project
- Product
- People
- Proccess



### Project

- *Our highest priorityis to satisfy the customer throught early and continuous delivery of **valuable software***
- ***Welcome changing requirements** even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer`s ompetitive advantage*
- ***Deliver** working software **frequently**, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale*
- *Agile processes promote **sustainable development**. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely*
- ***Working software** is the primary measure of **progress***

### Product

- ***Simplicity** is essential*
- *Continuous attention to **technical excellence** and good design enchances agility*

### People 

- *The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is **face-to-face conversation***
- ***Bussines** and **developers** must work **together** daily throughout the project*
- *The best archictectures, requirements, and designs emerge from **self-organizing teams***
- *Build projects around **motivated** individuals. **Give** them the environment and **support** they need, and **trust** them to get the job done.*


### Process

- *At **regular intervals**, the team **reflect** on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behaviour accordingly*

</br>

## **SCRUM Theory**

> Scrum is founded on **empiricism** and lean thinking. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed. Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials.

- `Transparency`: The emergent process and work must be visible to those   performing the work as well as those receiving the work.
- `Inspection`: The Scrum artifacts and the progress toward agreed goals must be inspected frequently and diligently to detect potentially undesirable variances or problems. To help with inspection, Scrum provides cadence in the form of its five events.
- `Adaptation`: A Scrum Team is expected to adapt the moment it learns anything new through inspection.

> **Transparency** enables inspection > **Inspection** enables adaptation > **Adaptation**

</br>

## **SCRUM Values**

> Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living five values.

- `Commitment`. 
- `Courage`.
- `Openness`.
- `Focus`.
- `Respect`.

</br>


## **SCRUM Team**

**`Composed by:`** 
- **Product Owner** (PO) [x1]
- **Scrum Master** (SM) [x1]
-  **Developers** (Devs) [< x10]

> If Scrum Team come large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive teams, each focused in same Product. **They should share same Product Goal, Product Owner and Product Backlog`**


### Product Owner.

- Maximizes the **value** delivery chain.
- Manages the **Product Backlog**.
- The Product Owner represents the interests of the business or community product stakeholders through the content and order of the Product Backlog.
- Customer interaction.
- Progress inpection.
- Product Owner musth have **authority**.

### Developers.
- They are responsible for transforming the idea reflected in the **Product Backlog** into **Incrementals**.
- **Self-Managed** and **Cross-Funcional**.

### Scrum Master.
- Is responsible to make **Scrum** run smoothly.
- Cause the removal of **impediments**.
- Coaching.
- Meeting facilitation.

</br>

## **SCRUM Artifacts**

Each artifact contains a commitment:

| Artifact        | Commitment        |
|-----------------|-------------------|
|`Product Backlog`| Product Goal      |
|`Sprint Backlog` | Sprint Goal       |
|`Incremental`    | Definition Of Done|

### Product Backlog

- Represent **work-to-do**
- Commitment: **Product Goal**
    - Is posible to have multiple product goal's, but the Scrum team will **focus** on one product goal at a time.
- The Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. 
- It list all features, functions, requirements, enhancements and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future release.
- It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team. 
- A **Product** has a **single* Product Backlog, no exceptions here.
- Epics -> User Storie
- The **Product Owner** orders it considering whatever he/she judges as appropiate. Order by 4 factors:
    - Size
    - Risk
    - Value
    - Dependences

#### **Monitoring progress***

Three diferents ways proposed by Scrum Guide to control/monitoring the progress:

- `Burn-down chart`: **top-to-bot** with remaining work to do and estimated remaining work to do (like story points) by unit of time (like sprints or days)
    
    ![Burn-down chart](img/burndown-chart.png)

- `Burn-up chart:` **bot-to-top**. Same that burndown chart but with the amount of work done and amount of work to do.

- `Cummulative flow chart.` 



### Sprint Backlog

- Represent **work-to-do**

### Incremental

- Represent **value**

</br>

## **SCRUM Events**

### Timmings.

- **`Sprint`**: No more than **1 month**. 
- **`Sprint planning`**: Maximun of **8 hours** for a for a one-month Sprint.
- **`Daily`**: **15 min**.
- **`Sprint Review`**: Maximun of **4 hours** for a for a one-month Sprint.
- **`Sprint Retrospective`**: Maximun of **3 hours** for a for a one-month Sprint.

</br>

    - *Is where we define how to the vision will be realized*
- **`Epics:`**:
    - *Short reminders of stuff that the product will have.*
    - *Briefly describe the product features.*

- **`Story Point:`**:
    - *Story points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall effort that will be required to fully implement a product backlog item or any other piece of work*
